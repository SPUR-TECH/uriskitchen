# Urai's Thai Kitchen
https://uriskitchen.herokuapp.com/

## Welcome Reader,

This is a description of this website and all I'ts workings.

## Project target:
---

Urai,s Thai Kitchen is a thai food delivery service for the hungry folk that like Thai food and of course an easy to use eye catching website to obtain such joys.
In this site the user can create an account so the next order will be easier with a simple login.
It,s also part of the Code Institute Fullstack Diploma Course and in this particular project using an Agile methodology I demonstrate the use of a database in two ways. Adding the menus via the admin section and summoning them back to the allocated pages with javascript. Saving the order in local storage and retrieving the order back to show my understanding of database usage.
I've given the user the ability to C.R.U.D. authentication to Create an order, Read back they,re order, Update it at any point until final purchase and of course Delete any items from that order until final purchase.

##  Screen shots of the site and it's responsive abilities:

I used http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ to check what it would look like on all devices but the live heroku site refused to work so I used my workspace url which did work this is the work space url https://8000-spurtech-uriskitchen-pe75eqmz4aa.ws-eu46.gitpod.io/.
As you can see it's fully responsive right across all devices and adapts to any screen sizes.
